To verify that our submission is working as intended please follow the below instructions:

Run the accompanying Python server. The program will not work without this.

* Ensure that you have Anaconda Python 3.8 installed on your machine with the module dill installed via pip.
* Navigate to the PrincetonPythonServer folder within the PrincetonGinRummyEAAISubmission folder.
* Run this with $ python3 Server.py

As a test, run the given TestPrincetonPlayer.class file with the command

$ java TestPrincetonPlayer

This function operates similarly to GinRummyGame.java. You should see 1 verbose game and 1 non-verbose game. This
will conclude with a statement "ALL GOOD!"; if you do not see this contact a team member.

** Our submission is PrincetonGinPlayer.class.

The submitted classes (PrincetonGinPlayer.class and SimpleGinRummyPlayer.class) were compiled with vermouth.jar, so as
a final test you can run

$ java -jar vermouth.jar --oneall --games 1 --agents 'file:./PrincetonGinPlayer' 'file:./SimpleGinRummyPlayer'

and observe the output .csv files within the produced .zip to verify that it is working.

For your convenience, we have also included within the submitted .zip all associated .java source code files.

Thank you,

The Princeton Gin Rummy Player Team
